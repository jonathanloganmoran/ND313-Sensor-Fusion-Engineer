        "Euclidean clustering is a type of [cluster analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) algorithm used to detect and group nearby points in a dataset. Using a [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) heuristic, each point's membership to its neighbours is considered. Points which are \"close\" in distance to each otoher are grouped together to form a local cluster. Through the use of a [nearest neighbour search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search), this \"closeness\" heuristic is explored, and the resulting set of clusters is approximated in the fashion of an optimisation problem. In other words, the \"most optimal\" set of resulting clusters is determined by grouping together the points whose distance between each other is minimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our application, we use Euclidean clustering to group the LiDAR points belonging to the distinct objects in our scene — the surrounding vehicles. We make use of the Point Cloud Library (PCL), which provides us with the [`pcl::EuclideanClusterExtraction`](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/cluster_extraction.html) class to perform the clustering. Using a [K-D Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) allows us to \"speed up\" the nearest neighbour search by organising points into a hierarchial strucutre, therefore restricting the number of total points that must be \"explored\" when forming each cluster. The K-D Tree is a special case of the [binary space partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning) tree structure, which \"splits\" the point space into branches based on the median values of the points along the chosen dimension(s). Once the tree is formed using the entire set of possible points, \"searching\" for nearby points becomes a matter of tree traversal, where the distance is checked against the nodes of the tree in a recursive manner. With the K-D Tree structure, we are able to more-efficiently perform \"look-up\" in $O\\left(\\mathrm{log}n\\right)$ time complexity."
