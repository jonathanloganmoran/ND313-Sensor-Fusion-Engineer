        "Euclidean clustering is a type of [cluster analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluster_analysis) algorithm used to detect and group nearby points in a dataset. Using a [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) heuristic, each point's membership to its neighbours is considered. Points which are \"close\" in distance to each otoher are grouped together to form a local cluster. Through the use of a [nearest neighbour search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search), this \"closeness\" heuristic is explored, and the resulting set of clusters is approximated in the fashion of an optimisation problem. In other words, the \"most optimal\" set of resulting clusters is determined by grouping together the points whose distance between each other is minimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "In our application, we use Euclidean clustering to group the LiDAR points belonging to the distinct objects in our scene — the surrounding vehicles. We make use of the Point Cloud Library (PCL), which provides us with the [`pcl::EuclideanClusterExtraction`](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/cluster_extraction.html) class to perform the clustering. Using a [K-D Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-d_tree) allows us to \"speed up\" the nearest neighbour search by organising points into a hierarchial strucutre, therefore restricting the number of total points that must be \"explored\" when forming each cluster. The K-D Tree is a special case of the [binary space partitioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning) tree structure, which \"splits\" the point space into branches based on the median values of the points along the chosen dimension(s). Once the tree is formed using the entire set of possible points, \"searching\" for nearby points becomes a matter of tree traversal, where the distance is checked against the nodes of the tree in a recursive manner. With the K-D Tree structure, we are able to more-efficiently perform \"look-up\" in $O\\left(\\mathrm{log}n\\right)$ time complexity."

        "The first point inserted into the K-D Tree naturally becomes the \"root\" node; at the very beginning when the tree is empty, the root node is `NULL`. After the first point is inserted, the root node is populated. In our case, the tree splits the $x$-axis region with the $x$-coordinate value of the first point inserted. In other words, for a first point $n_{1} = \\left(-6.2, 7.0\\right)$, we have a K-D Tree (of `depth = 0`) whose root is equal to the inserted point. This K-D Tree will have _left_ nodes with future points containing $x$-axis values _less than_ $-6.2$, and _right_ nodes with future points containing $x$-axis values _greater than_ $-6.2$. For the next point inserted (at `depth = 1`), we will split along the $y$-axis. For example, the point $n_{2} = \\left(-6.3, 8.4\\right)$ becomes the _left_ child node of the root, since its $x$-axis value $-6.3$ is less than the root with value $-6.2$. Our third point, $n _{3} = \\left(-5.2, 7.1\\right)$, then becomes the _right_ child node of thre root and remains at a `depth = 1` in the tree. A fourth point $n _{4} = \\left(-5.7, 6.3\\right)$, is inserted into the three. This time, the splitting axis is along the $y$-axis, which means that this node will be inserted at `depth = 2` in the tree, and become the _left_ child node of the third node $n_{3}$, since this fourth point has a $y$-coordinate value of $6.3$ which is _less than_ $7.1$, the $y$-coordinate value of the third point $n_{3}$.\n",

        "**Explanation**: The node $\\left(7.2, 6.1\\right)$ will be inserted at position $\\textrm{D}$ in the tree. This is because we traverse the tree from the root by first comparing the node's $x$-coordinate value, $7.2$, with the root, $-6.2$. Since the node with value $7.2$ is _greater than_ the root's $x$-value, we \"split\" to the right branch. At the next level (`depth = 1`), we now consider the node's $y$-coordinate value of $6.1$. Since this value is _less than_ the right child node's $y$-coordinate value of $7.1$, we move to the left sub-branch. At `depth = 2`, we are left with two possible positions, $\\textrm{C}$ and $\\textrm{D}$. By comparing the node's $x$-coordinate value of $7.2$ against the already-inserted node's value of $-5.7$, we determine the position at which the given node will be inserted into the tree is at location $\\textrm{D}$, since the value $7.2$ is _greater than_ $-5.7$. As you may have observed in this exercise, the \"axis\" we split at alternates with each iteration of `depth` in the tree — starting with $x$-axis at `depth = 0`, then $y$-axis at `depth = 1`, and so on...

For instance, consider the following four points:\n",

        "In this exercise we define the `insert` function, which will be used to insert new nodes into our tree structure. This function will recursively traverse the tree until a `NULL`-valued \"node\" has been found. In this case, where the discovered \"node\" is `NULL`, we update the \"empty\" node's address to be equal to the \"memory address\" of a new `Node` instance. With the new `Node` instantiated, we set its value (i.e., the `point` member variable) to be equal to the 2D Cartesian `point` coordinate we wish to insert into our K-D Tree at the `NULL` location found. We also assign the new `Node` an `id` value which corresponds to the current \"node\" we are inserting into the tree, i.e., a sequential counter determining the current node we are working with.\n",
        "\n",
        "To achieve the recursive nature of the intended `insert` function, we must create a \"helper\" function that performs the actual recurisve tree traversal operation. That is, we create an [overloaded function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-overloading-c/) which contains two additional input arguments: `node` and `depth`. These two arguments allow us to specify the current node and the \"depth\" of the tree we are considering at the respective iteration of the traversal. Together, these additional arguments allow us to \"update\" the memory address of the tree \"root\" to point to the current `node`, plus use the `depth` argument to determine which branch of the sub-tree to \"split\" next, i.e., whether we should consider the current node's left- or right child. The `depth` value determines which axis, $x$- or $y$-, we will \"look at\" and compare the values to. For further explanation of this mechanism, see the _Insertion_ sub-section of _Part 1.2: Using the K-D Tree_ above.      "
