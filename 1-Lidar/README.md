# Sensor Fusion Engineer Nanodegree
# Course 1: Lidar
#### By Jonathan L. Moran (jonathan.moran107@gmail.com)
From the Sensor Fusion Engineer Nanodegree programme offered at Udacity.

This is Course 1: Lidar in the Sensor Fusion Nanodegree programme taught by Aaron Brown and Michael Maile of Mercedes-Benz Research & Development North America (MBRDNA).


### Course Objectives
* Process raw LiDAR data with filtering, segmentation and clustering techniques;
* Perform object detection to detect vehicles on the road;
* Implement RANSAC with planar model fitting to segment point clouds;
* Implement Euclidean clustering with KD-Tree to cluster and distinguish vehicles and other obstacles.
